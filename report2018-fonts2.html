        The <a href="https://www.waikato.ac.nz/">University</a> also adopted a major change to its organisational structure in 2018, with the decision to implement a divisional leadership structure, comprising four new divisions, each lead by a Pro Vice-Chancellor. The new structure includes a Division of Education, Division of Management, Division of Health, Engineering, Computing and Science, and a Division of Arts, Law, Psychology and Social Sciences. Previously the University was organised into numerous faculties of widely varying sizes, all of which were headed by a Dean who reported directly to the Vice-Chancellor. Moving to a divisional structure will provide the University with the strategic leadership capability necessary for it to survive and prosper in today’s highly competitive and rapidly changing tertiary education environment, as well as providing a greater level of transparency of operational performance across academic units of a similar size. Implementation of the leadership and administrative structure within each of the divisions will continue during 2019.

        One of the great strengths of the University of Waikato is the open and collegial relationship between the <a href="https://www.waikato.ac.nz/about/organisations/wsu.shtml">Waikato Students’ Union</a> (WSU) and the senior leadership team of the University. The President and Executive of the WSU are key contributors to University strategy on all fronts. This year the WSU led a consultation process on the areas in which students wanted increases in funding to be applied. As a result, the University has increased its investment in support for student health and wellbeing, including the appointment of a <a href="https://www.waikato.ac.nz/students/health/mental/">Mental Health Nurse</a>, <a href="https://www.waikato.ac.nz/students/health/violence-prevention/">Violence Prevention Coordinator</a> and a <a href="https://www.waikato.ac.nz/library/portals/community-health/health-promotion/">Health Promotion Coordinator</a>.

        Following an extensive process of curriculum review in 2016 and 2017 led by <a href="https://www.waikato.ac.nz/staff-profiles/people/robynl/">Professor Robyn Longhurst (Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Academic)</a> and <a href="https://www.waikato.ac.nz/php/research.php?mode=show&author=24839">Professor Alister Jones (Senior Deputy Vice-Chancellor)</a>, the University’s new curricula at 100 and 200 level were offered for the first time in 2018. The redesigned curriculum will help the University to deliver on its ambition for a distinctive student experience by requiring Waikato undergraduate students to complete a cultural perspectives component, a disciplinary foundations component, and a work-integrated learning component. This new curriculum has required that we strengthen relationships with local employers to ensure meaningful work-integrated learning opportunities are available for students.

        The research performance of the University of Waikato, under the leadership of Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Research, <a href="https://www.waikato.ac.nz/staff-profiles/people/clarkson/">Professor Bruce Clarkson</a>, was also substantially improved in 2018. The University was successful in a number of national research funding rounds, many of which provide funding that extends beyond 2019 to provide a strong pipeline of future research funding. The University was awarded funding from the TEC through its Entrepreneurial Universities fund, the Marsden Fund, the Ministry of Education, MBIE, other government agencies and many private sector organisations. We also undertake collaborative research with a wide range of Crown Research Institutes, universities and Centres of Research Excellence. There has been a notable improvement in the success rates of research funding applications during 2018 and the University’s new research revenue contracted in 2018 ($41.7m) greatly exceeded the $28.9m contracted in 2017.

  For a long time in our urban centres, nature has been fighting a losing battle. Perhaps those living in residential areas had been comforted by the fact that the Department of Conservation and its predecessors have been doing their best to save our native birds from extinction on offshore islands, or more recently, mainland eco-sanctuaries. But, these endeavours on their own, are not enough to reverse the ongoing decline in native biodiversity. What if cities were seen as a solution to the problem and what needs to happen?

  Charles Fleming Award recipient Professor Bruce Clarkson will make the case for both community and local council endeavours to bring indigenous nature back into cities and towns where 87% of New Zealand’s population live. Bruce explains how the new transdisciplinary approach of Urban Ecology is working on reconnecting our neighbourhoods with nature to provide multiple benefits to urban dwellers.
